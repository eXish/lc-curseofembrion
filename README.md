# CurseOfEmbrion
A mod that adds the chance for Curse of Embrion on any moon. This curse significantly increases the chance for Old Birds to spawn, giving you a little taste of Embrion anywhere! If you roll the curse the moon's description on landing will to let you know you got it.

Certain properties can be modified using the configuration file such as how rare the curse is. By default the curse is fairly rare at a 10% chance.

To install the mod manually (outside Thunderstore) put the "CurseOfEmbrion.dll" file inside a folder called CurseOfEmbrion (or whatever you want to name it) under the BepInEx/plugins directory.
